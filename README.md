# Block-chain-based-storage-system-with-Privacy-and-Authentication-in-IoTs
This project implements a blockchain-based decentralized storage system for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, ensuring enhanced security, privacy, and authentication. It addresses key challenges such as limited storage, unauthorized data access, and security vulnerabilities in IoT-enabled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

ðŸš€ Key Features:

Decentralized Data Storage â€“ Eliminates reliance on a single server.
Privacy-Preserving Authentication â€“ Uses blockchain for secure identity verification.
Immutable Data Records â€“ Ensures integrity and prevents tampering.
Cloud-Based Storage â€“ Efficiently manages large volumes of IoT-generated data.
Smart Contract-Based Access Control â€“ Automates secure data transactions.
ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

Backend: Java, J2EE (JSP, Servlet)
Blockchain: Hyperledger / Ethereum
Database: MySQL
Encryption: AES, RSA
Frontend: Web-based user interface
ðŸ“Œ How It Works:

IoT sensor nodes collect data and send it to cluster heads.
Cluster heads validate, encrypt, and forward data to the base station.
The base station stores authentication keys on the blockchain while sending large data to the cloud.
Smart contracts regulate access and eliminate revoked certificates of malicious nodes.
ðŸ“„ Use Cases:
âœ… Secure IoT data storage
âœ… Privacy-focused decentralized file sharing
